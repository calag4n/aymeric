The goal was to develop a model with a similar approach as those presented
in state of the art papers for this disease and to enhance it using nlp. 
The dataset used was based on the *MIMIC* database and composed of 20742 adult patients with **more than 100000 features**. 
Our best model is based on *XGBoost* and has an auroc score of **86.5%** 24 hours before the event.
A second objective was model explainability and **real-time analysis of the predictions**. `,
